# Data Analysis Samples

These are some samples of data analysis projects I have done before:

 - [sample_COVID_religion_BR.md](sample_COVID_religion_BR.md) is a paper containing a probabilistic topical model of online religious responses to the pandemic, with a focus on Brazilian Evangelical groups during the first semester of 2020. It clarified to me some challenges in negotiating public policy decisions with multiple stakeholders.
 - [sample_religion_democracy_BR.md](sample_religion_democracy_BR.md) is a paper containing an exploratory analysis of the relationship between religious and democracy support variables in Brazil. I am especially proud of the function variable_selection in Appendix 1, which combines data from multiple years of the same survey using its codebook.
