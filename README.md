# Data Analysis Samples

These are some samples of data analysis projects I have done before:

 - [sample_COVID_religion_BR.md](sample_COVID_religion_BR.md) is a paper containing a probabilistic topical model of online religious responses to the pandemic, with a focus on Brazilian Pentecostal-charismatic groups during the first semester of 2020. It clarified to me some challenges in negotiating public policy decisions with multiple stakeholders.
 - [sample_religion_democracy_BR.md](sample_religion_democracy_BR.md) is a paper containing an exploratory analysis of the relationship between religious and democracy support variables in Brazil.
